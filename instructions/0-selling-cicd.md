## Section 1 - Explain the Fundamentals and Benefits of CI/CD to Achieve, Build, and Deploy Automation for Cloud-Based Software Products

You are leading a team to develop the UdaPeople product, a revolutionary concept in Human Resources which promises to help small businesses care better for their most valuable resource: their people. Before implementing CI/CD for the UdaPeople product, you need to get authorization from the people who write the checks. Create a proposal in document or presentation form that “sells” the concept of CI/CD to non-technical decision-makers in the UdaPeople organization. For this, you will need to step out of your technical world and step into the world of revenue and costs. You will need to translate the benefits of CI/CD from technical language to the values of the business. To appeal to what makes business people tick, you’ll need to focus your attention on benefits that create revenue, protect revenue, control costs or reduce costs.

The deliverable should be “near-production-quality”, but you should try to time-box your work to about 30 minutes. In other words, it should be good enough to submit to a real boss in a real job. No messy, last-minute submissions. You may use public domain or open source templates and graphics if you’d like. But please make sure the content is your own. Your presentation should be no longer than 5 slides. Your boss likes presentations that are short and sweet!

Your presentation should be in PDF format named "presentation.pdf" and should be included in your code repository root folder. 


# Adopt CI / CD

- Fundamentals:
	- **Continus Delivery**: a Software engineered practice / approach for teams to produce and release software code (versions) in short cycles, **deliver product to buyer as quickly as possible**
	
	- **Continuous Integration**: the practice of merging the all developers work, which helps to automatically prepare the code for Deployment, **Big short-cut to a lot of time consuming & Recuring processes so More Production is Achievable from Coding-Team**
	
	- **Continuous Deployment**: the practice of automating everything related to deploying the Software (the ARTIFACT / Result of CI), **another major decrease in time consumed by Many-Recuring processes so More Production is Achievable from Operations-Team**
	
- Benefits of the DevOps CI/CD Practice
	- **help teams ship code to production faster** by reducing manual tasks and making each step in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) consistent and repeatable.
	
	- Delivers changes to the product as soon as they are ready. **So the feedback loop between developers / engineers and customers is much shorter**, and the a fast responce to customer feedback will lead to more trust in the organization.
	
	- organizations can systemize software development and bring consistency to each stage and its corresponding output, **So developers can focus on more important work and remove the risk of human errors**
	
	- no more shipping large code changes that can take time to integrate and test with the code base, **CI/CD Helps in delivering better software with less issues more consistently**
	
	- CI/CD can help produce bug-free code **by applying a consistent suite of automated tests and providing a feedback loop**.
	
	- Developers will gain more confidence in delivering changes that might have seemed risky, meaning extra energy and more production.
	
	
- what it means for the teams
	- It is much easier for more than one team member to work on the same feature.
	- The cost of merging small changes is much lower than large changes.
	- Team members can evaluate their peer’s changes in a system that has passed automated testing rather than the moving target of a feature branch.
	- It is much easier for QA engineers to validate small changes iteratively in a consistent system, so detecting the source of errors becomes much simpler.
	- Features can get into the hands of customers in an earlier state. This means that if we’re on the wrong track, we can change direction after only a small investment.
